I solo develop an apps for android and iOS. 
This is the introduction page.

### Apps

- [Hangs up and vibrate](hangup-and-vib-en.md)
  - [Google Play Page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.boxjar.ichigo)
  - It is an application that adds a function to vibrate the smartphone when you hang up the phone
  - It is an application for Android. I tried to make it for iOS, but I couldn't get around the iOS restrictions, probably because I didn't check it well.
